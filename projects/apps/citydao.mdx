Blockchain technology has been largely confined to the digital sphere.  Current cities are technology enhanced, but not technology defined. CityDAO is exploring making assets and governance digitally legible to unleash accessibility, interoperability, and opportunity.  What Nakamoto and Buterin did for value and compute, we propose to do for the physical world.

CityDAO is exploring decentralized asset ownership on chain, starting with a piece of land in Wyoming. Each parcel of land is an NFT that can be owned collectively by the DAO collectively or by individuals. It is a DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, meaning it is managed by the community.
